# Exploring-In-Built-dataset-airquality-
Use in-built dataset ‘airquality’, 
a)	exploring the general feature of dataset using appropriate R functions.                                                                                              
b)	data cleansing .                                       
c)	consider ‘Temp’ attributes and compute the central and variational measures.                                                                            
d)	applied boxplot technique to detect outlier of ‘wind’ attribute.
